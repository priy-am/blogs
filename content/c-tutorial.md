## Introduction

Welcome to the C programming tutorial. This tutorial is designed to help you understand the basics of C programming, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Whether you are a beginner or someone looking to refresh your skills, this guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge to get started with C.

## What is C?

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most popular programming languages due to its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. C is often used for system programming, developing operating systems, and writing applications that require high performance.

## Why Learn C?

- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern programming languages like C++, Java, and Python have their roots in C. Learning C provides a strong foundation for understanding these languages.
- **Performance**: C is known for its performance and is often used in applications where speed and efficiency are critical.
- **Portability**: C programs can be easily ported to different platforms, making it a versatile choice for developers.
- **Control**: C provides low-level access to memory and system resources, giving developers more control over how their programs execute.

## Getting Started

To start programming in C, you will need a C compiler. Some popular options include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++. You can write your C programs in any text editor, but using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Eclipse can make the process easier.

## Basic Syntax

C programs are written in plain text and saved with a `.c` extension. The basic structure of a C program includes:

```c showLineNumbers {3} /printf/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
