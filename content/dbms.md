## Introduction

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. **MySQL** is one of the most popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), widely used in web applications and enterprise solutions.

---

## Basic Database Concepts

### What is a Database?
A **database** is an organized collection of data, which can be managed using a DBMS.

### What is MySQL?
**MySQL** is an open-source RDBMS that supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing databases.

### What is SQL?
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a language used to perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data in a relational database.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
An **ER Diagram** visually represents data entities and their relationships.

### ER Diagram Example:
Consider a simple **Student Management System** with entities:
- **Student (Student_ID, Name, Age, Address)**
- **Course (Course_ID, Course_Name, Credits)**
- **Enrollment (Enrollment_ID, Student_ID, Course_ID, Enrollment_Date)**

ER Diagram Representation:
```plaintext
+------------+        +-----------+        +------------+
|  Student   |        | Enrollment|        |   Course   |
+------------+        +-----------+        +------------+
| Student_ID |<------>| Student_ID|        | Course_ID  |
| Name       |        | Course_ID |<------>| Course_ID  |
| Age        |        | Enroll_DT |        | Course_NM  |
| Address    |        +-----------+        | Credits    |
+------------+                              +------------+
```

## MySQL Queries

### 1. Creating a Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE school;
USE school;
```
**What happens?**
- Creates a new database named `school`.
- Selects `school` as the active database.

### 2. Creating Tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Address TEXT
);
```
**What happens?**
- Creates a `Student` table with columns: `Student_ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `Address`.

### 3. Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO Student (Student_ID, Name, Age, Address)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20, 'New York');
```
**What happens?**
- Adds a new record for `John Doe` in the `Student` table.

### 4. Retrieving Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM Student;
```
**What happens?**
- Fetches all records from the `Student` table.

### 5. Updating Records
```sql
UPDATE Student SET Age = 21 WHERE Student_ID = 1;
```
**What happens?**
- Updates `John Doe`'s age to `21`.

### 6. Deleting Records
```sql
DELETE FROM Student WHERE Student_ID = 1;
```
**What happens?**
- Deletes `John Doe`'s record from the `Student` table.

### 7. Joining Tables
```sql
SELECT Student.Name, Course.Course_Name
FROM Student
JOIN Enrollment ON Student.Student_ID = Enrollment.Student_ID
JOIN Course ON Enrollment.Course_ID = Course.Course_ID;
```
**What happens?**
- Retrieves the names of students along with the courses they are enrolled in.

### 8. Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Student;
```
**What happens?**
- Returns the total number of students in the `Student` table.

### 9. Grouping Data
```sql
SELECT Age, COUNT(*) FROM Student GROUP BY Age;
```
**What happens?**
- Groups students by `Age` and counts how many students belong to each age group.

### 10. Using Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Student(Name);
```
**What happens?**
- Improves search performance by creating an index on the `Name` column.

## Keys in DBMS
Database Management Systems (DBMS) are essential for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data efficiently. MySQL is a popular relational database management system that supports SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval. This guide covers fundamental DBMS concepts, essential MySQL queries, and ER diagrams.

---

## Keys
### Primary Key
A **Primary Key** is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value for the primary key column and that the value is never NULL.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
```
Here, `student_id` is the **Primary Key**, ensuring each student has a unique ID.

### Foreign Key
A **Foreign Key** is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(50),
    student_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
);
```
Here, `student_id` in the `courses` table is a **Foreign Key**, referencing `student_id` in the `students` table.

---

## ALTER Query
The `ALTER` statement is used to modify an existing table structure by adding, deleting, or modifying columns.

### Adding a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
```
This adds a new column `email` to the `students` table.

### Modifying a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students MODIFY COLUMN age SMALLINT;
```
This modifies the data type of the `age` column.

### Deleting a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN email;
```
This removes the `email` column from the `students` table.

### Adding a Foreign Key Constraint
```sql
ALTER TABLE courses ADD CONSTRAINT fk_student FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id);
```
This adds a **Foreign Key constraint** to ensure referential integrity.



---

## Advanced MySQL Queries

### 1. Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudents()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Student;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```
**What happens?**
- Defines a stored procedure `GetStudents()` that retrieves all student records.

### 2. Triggers
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_student
BEFORE INSERT ON Student
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.Name = UPPER(NEW.Name);
```
**What happens?**
- Converts `Name` to uppercase before inserting a new student record.

### 3. Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentView AS
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student;
```
**What happens?**
- Creates a virtual table `StudentView` showing only `Name` and `Age`.

### 4. Transactions
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Student SET Age = 22 WHERE Student_ID = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```
**What happens?**
- Starts a transaction.
- Updates `John Doe`'s age.
- Rolls back the change, so `Age` remains the same.

### 5. Subqueries
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE Student_ID IN (SELECT Student_ID FROM Enrollment);
```
**What happens?**
- Retrieves names of students who are enrolled in at least one course.
